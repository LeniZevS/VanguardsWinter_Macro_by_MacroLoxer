This is a GUI version of the original Python macro script that auto inserts characters in the game.
The original script requires Visual Studio Code to run, which is annoying if you just want to use it quickly.

I made this so you don’t need to download Visual Studio Code or open any .py files.
Just download, open the program, press start, and it works.
This is for people who don’t want to deal with coding stuff and just want something simple and easy to use.
No setup with VS Code. No editing code. Just run it.
